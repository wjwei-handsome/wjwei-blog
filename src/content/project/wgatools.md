## Summary

With the rapid development of long-read sequencing technologies, the era of individual complete genomes
is approaching. We have developed wgatools, a cross-platform, ultrafast toolkit that supports a range of whole genome
alignment (WGA) formats, offering practical tools for conversion, processing, statistical evaluation, and visualization of
alignments, thereby facilitating population-level genome analysis and advancing functional and evolutionary genomics.
## Availability and Implementation
wgatools supports diverse formats and can process, filter, and statistically evaluate
alignments, perform alignment-based variant calling, and visualize alignments both locally and genome-wide. Built with
Rust for efficiency and safe memory usage, it ensures fast performance and can handle large datasets consisting of
hundreds of genomes. wgatools is published as free software under the MIT open-source license, and its source code is
freely available at https://github.com/wjwei-handsome/wgatools.
